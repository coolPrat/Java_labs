This document describes differences between the 5.005 release and the 5.6.0
release.
Perl 5.6.0 introduces the beginnings of support for running multiple
interpreters concurrently in different threads.  In conjunction with
the state of any given interpreter, it is possible to compile a
piece of code once in an interpreter, clone that interpreter
one or more times, and run all the resulting interpreters in distinct
threads.
interpreter level.  See perlfork for details about that.
This feature is still in evolution.  It is eventually meant to be used
to selectively clone a subroutine and data reachable from that
subroutine in a separate interpreter and run the cloned subroutine
in a separate thread.  Since there is no shared data between the
interpreters, little or no locking will be needed (unless parts of
the symbol table are explicitly shared).  This is obviously intended
to be an easy-to-use replacement for the existing threads support.
Support for cloning interpreters and interpreter concurrency can be

enables Perl source code changes that provide a clear separation between
the op tree and the data it operates with.  The former is immutable, and
can therefore be shared between an interpreter and all of its clones,
while the latter is considered local to each interpreter, and is therefore
copied for each clone.

The v1.2.3 syntax is also now legal in Perl.
To cope with the new versioning system's use of at least three significant
digits for each version component, the method used for incrementing the
subversion number has also changed slightly.  We assume that versions older
than v5.6.0 have been incrementing the subversion component in multiples of
10.  Versions after v5.6.0 will increment them by 1.  Thus, using the new

This document describes differences between the 5.005 release and the 5.6.0
release.
Perl 5.6.0 introduces the beginnings of support for running multiple
interpreters concurrently in different threads.  In conjunction with
the state of any given interpreter, it is possible to compile a
piece of code once in an interpreter, clone that interpreter
one or more times, and run all the resulting interpreters in distinct
threads.

This feature is still in evolution.  It is eventually meant to be used
to selectively clone a subroutine and data reachable from that
subroutine in a separate interpreter and run the cloned subroutine
in a separate thread.  Since there is no shared data between the
interpreters, little or no locking will be needed (unless parts of
the symbol table are explicitly shared).  This is obviously intended
to be an easy-to-use replacement for the existing threads support.
Support for cloning interpreters and interpreter concurrency can be

To cope with the new versioning system's use of at least three significant
digits for each version component, the method used for incrementing the
subversion number has also changed slightly.  We assume that versions older
than v5.6.0 have been incrementing the subversion component in multiples of
10.  Versions after v5.6.0 will increment them by 1.  Thus, using the new

Pod::Parser is a base class for parsing and selecting sections of
pod documentation from an input stream.  This module takes care of
identifying pod paragraphs and commands in the input and hands off the
parsed paragraphs and commands to user-defined methods which are free
to interpret or translate them as they see fit.
Pod::InputObjects defines some input objects needed by Pod::Parser, and
for advanced users of Pod::Parser that need more about a command besides
its name and text.
As of release 5.6.0 of Perl, Pod::Parser is now the officially sanctioned
Pod::Text (pod2text) and Pod::Man (pod2man) have already been converted

This utility checks pod files for correct syntax, according to

These modules provide a set of gizmos that are useful mainly for pod

function is generally useful to all script authors since it lets them
write and maintain a single source (the pods) for documentation, thus
removing the need to create and maintain redundant usage message text
consisting of information already in the pods.
There is also a pod2usage script which can be used from other kinds of
scripts to print usage messages from pods (even for non-Perl scripts
with pods embedded in comments).
